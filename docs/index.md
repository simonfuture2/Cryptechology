Welcome to my Blockchain Portfolio!

Cryptocurrency is changing the way we transact and incentvize behavior in our community. The best part about crypto to me is blockchain technology, the secret sauce behind the Dapps. Decentralized applications are used to interact with the blockchain by using a browser based wallet or cold wallet. A wallet is a place to store your tokens and the blockchain uses it to have an address on the blockchain to find you. Wallets works differently than a fiat banking account, because it is not connected to a person. A blockchain wallet can be held be any person, entity, corporaiton, thing or robot, because of the way the backend is setup. The cool thing about this, is that a future can have machines working for any individual using smart contracts to interact with the blockchain and essential automate the process of putting your crypto to work. you can work on other areas of your life, while your crypto is generating token flow with yield farming or trading. This is just the beginning of the benefits of blockchain.
